# Conceptual documentation
## Overview

Conceptual documentation provides high-level explanations and understanding of a particular concept, idea, or system. It aims to explain the fundamental principles, features, and relationships that underpin a topic, making it easier for readers to grasp the concept as a whole.

By providing a conceptual overview of a topic, conceptual documentation empowers readers to understand the fundamental aspects and principles associated with the concept, setting the stage for more detailed or technical documentation that may follow.
