# Welcome! 
Hello! My name is Azul Valente. I am a certified English to Spanish translator and technical writer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

My passion for languages and learning new things led me to pursue a career in translation at the University of Buenos Aires. Since my graduation, I have been proving services as a sworn translator, while also gained valuable corporate experience in technical writing and project coordination.

In this website, you can find a collection of templates showcasing my work as a technical writer. 

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me! ðŸ˜€
