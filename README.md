# Welcome! 
Hello! My name is Azul Valente. I am a certified English to Spanish translator and technical writer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

My passion for languages and learning new things led me to pursue a career in translation at the University of Buenos Aires. In 2021, I began working as a technical writer, which allows me to use my linguistic and writing skills to create functional and practical documentation.

In this website, you a collection of templates showcasing my work as a technical writer. 

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me! ðŸ˜€
